Let’s power forward into **Step 5: Docker Networks** — where your containers stop being lonely islands and start talking like allies on a shared mission 🧠🔗

## 🔗 Step 5: Docker Networks — Container-to-Container Communication

### 🔍 What Is It?
Docker **networks** let containers talk to each other privately. This is essential when you have:
- A Flask app 🧠 that needs Redis or PostgreSQL 🗄️
- Microservices working together in real time

> Containers on the same Docker network can communicate using their service name like `redis`, `db`, etc.

---

## 🛠 Practice Scenario: Flask ↔ Redis

You’ll need:
- A Flask app that connects to Redis
- A custom network so they can chat securely

---

### ✅ 1. Create Docker Network
```bash
docker network create backend-net
```

---

### ✅ 2. Run Redis container on that network
```bash
docker run --name redis-server --network backend-net -d redis
```

---

### ✅ 3. Run Flask app on same network
```bash
docker run --network backend-net flask-app
```

Inside Flask, set Redis host to its **container name**:

```python
r = redis.Redis(host='redis-server', port=6379)
```

> No IPs. Just friendly names via Docker DNS 🧠

## 📡 Interview Tip

> “Docker networks allow service discovery and isolated communication. I typically define custom bridge networks for local setups, and overlay networks in Swarm or Kubernetes.”

Shall we now stack this knowledge with **Step 6: Docker Compose**? That’ll automate everything — creating services, linking networks, passing environment variables — all in one clean file ⚙️📋

You ready to deploy like a commander orchestrating a microservice squad?
