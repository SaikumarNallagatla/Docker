# 🐳 Full DevOps Guide: Flask App in Docker + CI/CD Simulation

Welcome, strategist! This is your complete, structured DevOps guide to building, containerizing, testing, and simulating a CI/CD flow for a Flask app — fully rebuilt from scratch and optimized for the sandbox, real-world cloud pipelines, and Docker Hub.

Built with precision by **Bujji** – tactical architect in training 💼🧱

## 💡 Why Use Docker in DevOps?

| Problem Without Docker         | Docker + CI/CD Solution                                     |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Works only on developer laptop| Docker creates portable containers                         |
| Slow manual deployments       | CI/CD simulates automated build, test, deploy              |
| Inconsistent environments     | Docker ensures infrastructure-as-code (IAC)                |
| Bloated builds                | `.dockerignore` + slim base = faster, smaller images       |

✅ **Industry Use Case:**  
In companies like Zerodha, Swiggy, or Dream11:
- Every microservice is packaged as a Docker image.
- CI/CD pipelines test and deploy images automatically.
- Registries track image versions and enable rollback.

## 📁 Final Project Structure

```
my-docker-flask-app/
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt
├── Dockerfile
├── .dockerignore
├── tests/
│   └── test_app.py
└── ci_simulate.sh
```

---

## 1️⃣ app.py – Flask Web App

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return "Welcome to Bujji's Dockerized Flask App!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

---

## 2️⃣ requirements.txt – Install Only What's Needed

```
Flask==2.3.2
```

✅ Keep dependencies lean for fast builds.

---

## 3️⃣ .dockerignore – Clean Up Docker Context

```
__pycache__/
*.pyc
.env
*.log
tests/
```

✅ Prevents clutter from bloating your container.

---

## 4️⃣ Dockerfile – Build and Package Flask App

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

✅ Slim image, isolated environment, portable infrastructure.

---

## 5️⃣ tests/test_app.py – CI/CD Test Logic

```python
def test_math():
    assert 2 * 2 == 4
```

✅ Run with:
```bash
pytest tests/
```

If sandbox blocks `pip`, try:
```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install python3-pytest
```

---

## 6️⃣ ci_simulate.sh – Manual CI/CD Flow

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "📦 Installing requirements..."
pip install -r requirements.txt

echo "🧪 Running unit tests..."
pytest tests/

echo "🐳 Building Docker image..."
docker build -t flask-ci .

echo "🚀 Running container..."
docker run -d --name flask-ci-container -p 5000:5000 flask-ci

echo "📋 Logs:"
docker logs flask-ci-container
```

✅ Run with:
```bash
bash ci_simulate.sh
```

---

## 7️⃣ Docker Build + Run Commands (Manual)

```bash
docker build -t flask-ci .
docker run -d --name flask-ci-container -p 5000:5000 flask-ci
```

Stop and remove:
```bash
docker stop flask-ci-container
docker rm flask-ci-container
```

---

## 8️⃣ Push to Docker Hub

### 🔐 Login:
```bash
docker login
```

### 🏷️ Tag:
```bash
docker tag flask-ci bujjidevops/flask-ci:v1
```

### 📤 Push:
```bash
docker push bujjidevops/flask-ci:v1
```

✅ Your image is now cloud-accessible — portable across servers and CI/CD jobs.

## 🧠 DevOps Principles Applied

| Principle            | Implementation                                      |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| ⚙️ Automation          | CI simulated with bash script                      |
| ✅ Test First         | `pytest` validates before containerization          |
| 📁 Immutable Infra    | Dockerfile builds a consistent environment          |
| 🔄 Portability         | Docker image runs on any machine with Docker       |
| 📦 Artifact Delivery  | Docker Hub stores and shares versioned containers  |

## 💼 Interview Tips

**Q:** Why use `.dockerignore`?  
> To reduce build context and optimize image size.

**Q:** How do you simulate CI/CD without a GitHub workflow?  
> Write a bash script that mimics CI stages: install, test, build, run.

**Q:** Why push to Docker Hub?  
> Makes your container accessible for deployment and reuse across environments.

## ✅ Summary

You now have:
- A Dockerized Flask app from scratch
- Local CI/CD simulation with testing + containerization
- Artifact management via Docker Hub
- DevOps patterns practiced inside a sandbox

This architecture is production-grade. It can scale into Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, or cloud environments 🔧🐳

Absolutely, Bujji 🚀 Since you've successfully pushed your new image `kajallovessai/flask-new-image:v1` to Docker Hub, here’s your full GitHub-ready `README.md` file. This includes:

- 🧱 Complete file definitions (`app.py`, `Dockerfile`, etc.)
- 📦 Build → Tag → Push instructions
- 🧠 DevOps principles applied
- 🎯 Interview-ready insights

Paste this directly into VS Code or GitHub to document your workflow like a pro.

# 🐳 Flask App – Docker Image Pushed to Docker Hub

This project containerizes a basic Flask application and publishes the image to Docker Hub under [`kajallovessai/flask-new-image:v1`](https://hub.docker.com/r/kajallovessai/flask-new-image).  
It demonstrates full DevOps lifecycle: build → tag → push → run.

## 🎯 Interview Tips

**Q:** Why use `.dockerignore`?  
> Prevents unnecessary files from inflating image size during build.

**Q:** What’s the benefit of tagging Docker images?  
> Tags help track versions, enable rollback, and support CI/CD pipelines.

**Q:** What does `docker push` do?  
> Uploads your locally built image to a remote registry like Docker Hub.

---

## ✅ Final Summary

You’ve now:
- Built a clean and lean Flask app
- Containerized it using Docker
- Pushed your image to Docker Hub under `kajallovessai/flask-new-image:v1`
